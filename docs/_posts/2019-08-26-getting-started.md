Welcome to Quintype :-).

In this post we will cover how to get started, building a Quintype publisher app with React, Node and the Malibu framework.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, please ensure the following is installed on your development machine
* [Node LTS](https://nodejs.org) (10.15 at the time of writing)
* Either [Supervisor](http://supervisord.org) or [Docker](https://www.docker.com) for running the development server

It is also strongly recommended that you have a working knowledge of the following before you get started
* How to use [React](https://reactjs.org) to build a front end application
* ES6 functionalily, including concepts like [promises](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/promises) and [async/await](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/async-functions)

In many of these examples, we will be using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) for development. It's fine if you use another editor, but some of the keyboard shortcuts and intellisense may not work.
